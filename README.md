# Woven Monopoly (Ruby CLI Version)

This is a beginner-friendly Ruby version of the Woven Monopoly game.  
It’s a simple command-line app where the dice rolls are set ahead of time, the game is deterministic.

## How to Play

- 4 players: Peter, Billy, Charlotte, Sweedal
- Everyone starts with **$16** and begins on **GO**
- Roll values are preloaded from a JSON file (so the game is predictable)
- You earn **$1** every time you pass GO
- If you land on an unowned property, you **must** buy it
- If you land on someone else’s property, you pay rent
  - Rent is doubled if the owner has all properties of that color
- The game ends when **someone goes bankrupt**
- The player with the **most money left** wins
